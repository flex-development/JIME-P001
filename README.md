## Getting Started

Morena's Kustomz is an online store that specializes in "pot head" necessities.
While enjoying a MySpace inspired UI, users can shop pre-made ash trays,
grinders, and rolling trays, or have them custom made.

This project is formatted as a monorepo with packages for a [Storybook][8]
design system, Shopify storefront powered by [Next.js][4], and shared
[TypeScript][9] declarations.
