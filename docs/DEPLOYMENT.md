## Getting Started

Vercel is a hosting platform for static sites and serverless functions. It'll be
used to host our Storybook and Next.js applications.

> The [Vercel for GitHub][1] integration automatically deploys your GitHub
> projects with Vercel, providing [Preview Deployment URLs][2], and automatic
> [Custom Domain][3] updates.

To enable the Vercel for Git Integration, a Vercel project needs to be connected
to our Git repository.
