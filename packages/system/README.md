## Getting Started

This project is a [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) design system for
Morenas Kustomz.

Morenas Kustomz is an online store that specializes in "pot head" necessesities.
While enjoying a MySpace inspired UI, users can shop premade ash trays,
grinders, and rolling trays, or have them custom made.

## Usage

### Local

1. Be sure the package is built before attempting to install it

   If the script you're using doesn't already build the package, run
   `lerna run prepare --scope @flex-development/kustomz`

2. Add `"@flex-development/kustomz": "*"` to your project `dependencies`

3. Run `yarn` to re-install the project dependencies (if needed)

### ðŸš§ Production

TODO: Update documentation.
