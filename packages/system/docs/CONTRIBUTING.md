## Integrations

### AddThis

[AddThis](https://www.addthis.com/) is a content sharing platform. In addition
to providing content sharing tools, AddThis provides tool for following, related
posts, social analytics, and Audience Targeting tools.

This Inline Follow and Share buttons can be used through the `AddThisToolbox`
component. Inline share buttons are also a part of the `ProductTemplate` UI.

## Making Changes

### Component Library

Directory: `src/lib`

The component library is organized according to the
[Atomic Design Methodology](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/).

Component stories live in the same directory as their components. For more
information on writing stories, visit
[Writing Stories](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-stories/introduction)
from the Storybook docs.

### Hooks

Directory: `src/hooks`

The component library is implemented as a set of Function components, making the
use of [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) possible.

This project uses [React Hanger](https://github.com/kitze/react-hanger), a
"helpful hooks" library.

For more information on writing custom hooks, visit
[Building Your Own Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-custom.html) from the
React docs.

### ðŸš§ Providers

Directory: `src/providers`

**TODO**: Update documentation.

### Styles

Directory: `src/scss`

Stylesheets are written in [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/); this project
currently supports the `.scss` syntax.

### Type Definitions

Directory: `src/types`

### Utilities

Directory: `src/utils`

## Testing

Unit and interaction tests are conducted while implementing a new component or
feature. Unit tests are used to verify the output of a component, hook, or
function against a fixed input value. Interaction tests render components in the
browser and assert qualities about the way the component renders or changes.

[CSF format](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/api/csf) stories are reusable
components that can be rendered outside of Storybook, making them available to
use when writing tests. For more information, visit
[Unit testing](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/workflows/unit-testing) and
[Interaction testing](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/workflows/interaction-testing)
from the Storybook docs.

This project uses the following testing libraries:

- [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)
- [React Hooks Testing Library](https://react-hooks-testing-library.com/)
- [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/react)

Test results for components are displayed in Storybook using
[Storybook Addon Jest](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/tree/master/addons/jest).
Before running or building the project, `__tests__/jest-test-results.json` must
be generated. The Jest addon uses this file to display test results. Failing
tests will not hinder builds, but be displayed in the addon panel.

The `dev` and `build` scripts for this project are configured to run the test
suite before starting or building the project.

## Documentation

[Storybook Docs](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-docs/introduction)
is used to generate documentation for the component library. DocBlock comments
for components needs to be
[written using Markdown](https://typedoc.org/guides/doccomments/#markdown) in
order to be parsed properly by Storybook Docs.

All other documentation should follow [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app) format.

## ðŸš§ Build Workflow

**TODO**: Update documentation.
