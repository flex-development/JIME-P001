## Introduction

> _Modern user interfaces are assembled from hundreds of modular UI components
> that are rearranged to deliver different user experiences. Design systems
> contain reusable UI components that help teams build complex, durable, and
> accessible user interfaces across projects. Since both designers and
> developers contribute to the UI components, the design system serves as a
> bridge between disciplines. It is also the “source of truth” for an
> organization’s common components._ -

## Installation & Setup

1. Add `"@flex-development/kustomzdesign": "*"` to package `dependencies`

   **Note**: The design system package isn't published, so it can only be
   installed in projects within the Morena's Kustomz monorepo.

2. Run `yarn` from the root of the repository to re-install project dependencies

3. Add the WebFont Loader and AddThis scripts to your project:

   ```html
   <!-- WebFont Loader -->
   <script
     type="text/javascript"
     src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/webfont/1.6.26/webfont.js"
   ></script>

   <!-- Load custom fonts -->
   <script>
     try {
       WebFont.load({ typekit: { id: 'oee3tpl' } })
     } catch (error) {
       console.error({ 'WebFont.load': error })
     }
   </script>

   <!-- AddThis -->
   <script
     type="text/javascript"
     src="//s7.addthis.com/js/300/addthis_widget.js#pubid=ra-60103a572a723aa0"
   ></script>
   ```

4. Import the design system stylesheet

   ```typescript
   import '@flex-development/kustomzdesign/kustomzdesign.css'
   ```

   Sass variables, mixins, placeholders, and functions can also be imported:

   ```scss
   @import '@flex-development/kustomzdesign/src/scss/abstracts/abstracts';
   ```

5. Import and initalize provider components

   ```typescript
   import { CartContextProvider } from '@flex-development/kustomzdesign'

   const App = props => {
     return (
       <CartContextProvider items={[]} persist={persistCartCB}>
         {/* content */}
       </CartContextProvider>
     )
   }
   ```
