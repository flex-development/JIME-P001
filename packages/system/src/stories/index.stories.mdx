## Introduction

> _Modern user interfaces are assembled from hundreds of modular UI components that are rearranged to deliver different user experiences. Design systems contain reusable UI components that help teams build complex, durable, and accessible user interfaces across projects. Since both designers and developers contribute to the UI components, the design system serves as a bridge between disciplines. It is also the ‚Äúsource of truth‚Äù for an organization‚Äôs common components._ - [Design Systems for Developers: Introduction](https://www.learnstorybook.com/design-systems-for-developers/react/en/introduction/)
