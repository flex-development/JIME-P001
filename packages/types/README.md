## Getting Started

This project is used to support the development of `@flex-development/kustomz`
and `@flex-development/morenaskustomz`, the design system and storefront
projects for Morenas Kustomz.

Morenas Kustomz is an online store that specializes in "pot head" necessesities.
While enjoying a MySpace inspired UI, users can shop premade ash trays,
grinders, and rolling trays, or have them custom made.

## Usage

2. Add `"@flex-development/kustomtypez": "*"` to your project `dependencies`

3. Run `yarn` to re-install the project dependencies (if needed)
